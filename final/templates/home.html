				The airlines’ demand were negatively impacted due to the air passengers’
				loss of confidence as well as increased frustration towards stricter
				security measures. After the 911 terrorist attacks, the federal government
				took over commercial airport security through a newly created agency, the
				Transportation Security Administration. The resulting gantlet of airport
				screening measures has made flying more time-consuming and burdensome,
				requiring millions of travelers to shed their shoes and coats at crowded
				security checkpoints, and to march through high-tech scanners that peer
				through their clothes. <br /><br />
				In addition, the consumer experience went down as air carrier companies
				want to stop their losses of profits by increasing fee for luggages,
				cutting expenses such as food or employees. It took 3 years for customers
				to slowly return to airlines after the 911 attacks.

				<span style="font-size:30px;">To take a closer look,</span> we are
				interested in airline companies directly involved in the 911 attack,
				which means their planes were hijacked. We wonder if they were affected
				differently compared to other airline companies. Two UA (United Airlines)
				planes and two AA(American Airlines) planes got hijacked in
				the 911 attack. Therefore, we chose 6 largest airline companies
				in 2001 including UA and AA and analyzed two variables: the number
				of passengers and the number of seats. The number of passengers
				represents the actual number of boarding passengers and the number
				of seats represents the number of available seats provided by the airline.
				In other words, the number of passengers represents demand and the number of
				seats represents supply.
				<br /><br />We found something interesting.

				<!-- TODO: select only AA -->
				<h3>Growth in AA's supply and demand not expected.</h3>
				<p>After 911 attack,all airline companies had their number of
					passengers and seats decreased to varying degrees except AA.
					Actually AA made a great jump in the number of both passengers
					and seats, which seems strange considering that AA was
					directly involved in 911. We later took a look at AA's
					revenue report around 2001 and found the possible reason.</p>
			</div>

			<div class='step'>
				<h3>US Airways disproportionately affected</h3>
				<p>US Airways experienced a severe and long-lasting decrease
					in number of both passengers and seats. after 911 attack.
					As the largest carrier at Washington National Airport, US
					Airways was disproportionately affected by that airport's
					extended closure following the September 11 terrorist
					attacks. The resulting financial disaster precipitated
					the closure of the airline's MetroJet network, which
					led to the de-hubbing of the subsidiary's primary operating
					base at Baltimore-Washington International Airport and
					the furloughing of thousands of employees.</p>
